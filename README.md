# dnd-api

features I plan to implement still: 

in instances that higher level versions of spells pull no information from API. it seems appropriate to hide the h3 used to label that information

when pulling associated spell level -- take the number value received and put it in a format that more closely resembles that of the players handbook 

ex 1 --> 1st level
ex 8 --> 8th level
ex 0 --> cantrip

change search to change spaces to hyphens and convert text input to lowercase
